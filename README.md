Rust Developer & AWS Solution Architect
------------------------

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a software developer with a borderline unhealthy obsession with Rust and LLMs. I have experience with fine-tuning AI models and have way too many Telegram bots. Seriously, it's a problem. When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably tinkering with Linux and electronics.

I'm all about collaborating on cool projects, especially if they involve AI. Speaking of which, check out my useful telegram bot for transcribing voice notes and more: [duck_transcriber](https://github.com/DuckyBlender/duck_transcriber)
