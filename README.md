# DuckyBlender
Hi there! My name is DuckyBlender and I am a software developer with a passion for rust and Python. I love creating discord bots and have experience building them using the Python programming language. I am also a member of the Moveit organization, where I contribute to a variety of projects and collaborate with other like-minded developers. In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the world of technology and attending hackathons and programming competitions. Thanks for visiting my profile and I hope to collaborate with you on future projects!
