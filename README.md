Hi 👋 My name is Alan

Rust Developer & Student
------------------------

I am a software developer with a passion for Rust and Python. I love creating discord and telegram bots and have experience building them using the Rust programming language. I am also a member of the Moveit organization, which aim to help with public transport. I contribute to a variety of projects and collaborate with other like-minded developers. In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the world of technology (epecially AI) and attending hackathons and programming competitions. Thanks for visiting my profile and I hope to collaborate with you on future projects!
