Hi there! 👋 I'm Alan
=====================

Rust Developer & Student
------------------------

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a software developer with a borderline unhealthy obsession with Rust and LLMs. I have experience with fine-tuning AI models and I have a knack for creating way too many Telegram bots. Seriously, it's a problem. When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably tinkering with Linux, and yes, I'm currently diving into the magical world of NixOS.

I'm all about collaborating on cool projects, especially if they involve AI. Speaking of which, check out my telegram bot which uses my own fine-tuned models: [sussy_ducky_bot](https://github.com/DuckyBlender/sussy_ducky_bot)
